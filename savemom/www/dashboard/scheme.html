                        <li>&nbsp; Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is a safe motherhood intervention under the National Rural Health Mission (NHM).</li><br>
                        
                        <li>&nbsp;It is being implemented with the objective of reducing maternal and neonatal mortality by promoting institutional delivery among poor pregnant women.</li><br>
                       
                        <li>&nbsp;Janani Suraksha Yojana was launched in April 2005 by modifying the National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS).</li><br>
                       
                        <li>&nbsp; The NMBS provides for financial assistance of Rs. 500/- per birth up to two live births to the pregnant women who have attained 19 years of age and belong to the below poverty line (BPL) households.</li><br>
                       
                        <li>&nbsp;When JSY was launched the financial assistance of Rs. 500/- , which was available uniformly throughout the country to BPL pregnant women under NMBS, was replaced by graded scale of assistance based on the categorization of States as well as whether beneficiary was from rural/urban area.</li><br>
                       
                        <li>&nbsp;A woman gets Rs.1,400 for delivery in a government facility or accredited private facility and Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) gets Rs. 600 in rural areas.</li><br>
                     
                        <li>&nbsp;In the urban areas, the amounts paid are Rs.1,000 and Rs. 400 respectively.</li><br>
                       
                        <li>&nbsp;The financial entitlement was Rs. 700 to the mother and Rs. 600 for the ASHA in rural areas and Rs. 600 and Rs. 400 in urban settings.
