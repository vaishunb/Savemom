                     Relax the upper body completely while standing straight. <br>

                    When you are ready to begin, breathe in deeply. <br>
                    As you inhale, squat down a few inches and slowly rotate your hips in a circular motion.<br>
                     Keep knees loose, and focus on keeping your chest facing forward, isolating the movement in the hips.<br>

                     Continue inhaling and exhaling, rotating your hips and ensuring that your tailbone is tucked in (to avoid over-arching your back).<br>
                      Keep your neck and back straight.<br>
                       Repeat rotations 10 times clockwise and then 10 times anti-clockwise.
