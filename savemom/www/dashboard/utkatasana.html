            <b>   • Keep your movements smooth and slow.<br>
• Focus on a point on the wall or floor in front of you to help you balance.<br>
• Hormone changes and the extra weight of pregnancy may weaken your pelvic floor.<br> Always draw up you pelvic floor muscles when moving into or out of standing poses.<br>
• Your centre of gravity changes as your pregnancy progresses.<br> If you have problems balancing in the standing poses, stand near a wall or have a chair within reach to help steady you.<br>
• Always listen to your body – never force yourself into a pose, and release any pose as soon as your breathing becomes heavy.
